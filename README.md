# OpenAICrimeSpeechScanner
Welcome to AudioCrimeAnalyzer, an innovative FastAPI application designed to leverage the cutting-edge capabilities of OpenAI's models for crime detection through speech analysis. This project combines advanced machine learning techniques and the power of FastAPI to create a robust and scalable solution aimed at identifying potential criminal content within audio files.

Key Features:

Speech-to-Text Conversion: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model to accurately convert voice recordings into text.
AI-Driven Analysis: Employs OpenAI's GPT models to analyze the transcribed text for indications of criminal activity.
Crime Category Detection: Classifies content into categories such as 'fraud', 'theft', 'abuse', and 'safe', providing a quick and automated assessment of the audio content.
FastAPI Framework: Built with FastAPI, ensuring high performance, easy scalability, and real-time analysis capabilities.
Potential Use-Cases:

Law Enforcement: Assisting in preliminary investigations by analyzing audio evidence.
Content Moderation: Screening audio content for harmful or illegal material in digital platforms.
Compliance Monitoring: Ensuring compliance with legal standards in business communications.
How It Works:

Upload an audio file through the FastAPI endpoint.
The application converts the speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
The text is then analyzed using another OpenAI model to categorize the content based on predefined criminal categories.
The result is returned, providing insights into the nature of the content.
